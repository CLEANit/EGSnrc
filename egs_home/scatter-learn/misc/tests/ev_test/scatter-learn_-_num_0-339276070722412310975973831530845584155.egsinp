# Usage:

# Put this file in $EGS_HOME/scatter-learn (along with all the accompanying .dat
# files), then issue the command:
#
#   scatter-learn -i scatter-learn.egsinp
#
# Add the "-b" flag to redirect standard output to scatter-learn.egslog, which
# contains the sought results.


# Viewer:

# To view the geometry with tracks and nice colours:
#
#   egs_view scatter-learn.egsinp scatter-learn.ptracks scatter-learn.egsview &
#
# (remove scatter-learn.ptracks if you don't generate tracks)


# Comments:

# Pick lower Z elements, for much faster simulations. High-z elements are
# typically used in shielding, imaging is usually geared towards biology (low-Z,
# C, H, O, Ti for medical implants, trace metals) or technical inspection
# (typically Al and metals).

# It might be instructive at first to look at high density contrast, for better
# signal discrimination (and thus, I am guessing, more efficient learning). Below
# I am considering air (~0.001 g/cm^3), water (~1) and aluminum (~2.7), for
# example. Higher-Z will also give you strong contrast, but again for the sake of
# simulation efficiency you'll prefer low Z for starters.

# For the voxel data, I use the include file functionality. I generate the "set
# medium = reg index" lines in a separate text file with the included python
# script. There are also other input format to input data from a voxelized
# medical images, but this is the simplest until we deal with real medical data.
# Same "includefile" idea for the detector grid and media.

# For the detector, I used Ge (germanium), which is the typical crystalline
# material used for high-resolution detectors. Lead stops photons more
# efficiently, but not detector is made of lead. Again, you can play around with
# it at will, just trying to set up a scenario that you can claim as realistic.

# For the energy, using higher energies will be slower, but provide more signal,
# so there is a trade off (which also depends on Z etc.). To give some
# perspective, medical imaging is ~ 0.1 MeV, and photon radiation therapy is ~ 10
# MeV, so anything in that range has a realistic end point. Below I pick 0.1 MeV,
# in the imaging domain.

# Note that there distinct physics at play: 1-100 keV implies more photoelectric
# interactions, between ~ 100 keV -- 1 MeV is the Compton regime, and above 1.022
# MeV (twice the electron rest mass) pair creation becomes possible and
# eventually dominates. this might be important for learning applications,
# because for example below 1.022 MeV pair creation is completely absent, and
# perhaps this becomes a different class of training set (or maybe not, even
# better!). At any rate, the graph of the relative cross section for the elements
# under study can help identify distinct regimes, if needed.


# Results:

# The code spits out the energy deposited and dose (energy per unit mass) in each
# germanium "pixel". Energy is the relevant measurand for a photon detector
# (dose is relevant for biological effect). The output is just a list of values
# for each region number (media germanium_even and germanium_odd), scanning the
# detector in x and y. Then you are on your own to process that towards an
# image format :-), e.g., a quick pipe to get pixel intensities (energies):
#
#   cat scatter-learn.egslog | grep germanium_ | awk '{print $1, $5, $7/100*$5}'

# In terms of results, I can run this input file for 1e6 histories (independent
# incident particles), and get germanium energy values to within 0.30 relative
# uncertainty, in about 3.1 seconds on a single CPU (when tracks generation is
# disabled). The uncertainty decreases as 1/sqrt(N), so to reach 0.01 relative
# uncertainty (a reasonable goal), one needs about 100 times as many histories, or
# 1e9. This could be achieved in an hour on a single CPU, and seconds on our
# cluster (or yours, or GPSC, what have you). Keep in mind that without there are
# many tricks, e.g., raytrace photons and estimate energy deposition with track
# length, which can speed this up by orders of magnitude. Once you get going, we
# can tak about that.


# Hints:

# length units are cm
# energy units are MeV
# run control block is at the end of the file; order of blocks does not matter

    ### energy cutoffs

    # hint: by setting ECUT very high (above the source energy), we are
    # effectively turning off electron transport: electrons stop and deposit
    # their energy locally as soon as they are created (it is still important to
    # create them, to get the proper energy loss on the photons). This is a crude
    # approximation, especially as the energy increase, but speeds up the
    # simulation (~ factor 5 at 0.1 MeV) since electron transport is the costly
    # part of radiation Monte Carlo (lots of interactions in matter for charged
    # particles). So eventually you want to dial the ECUT value down to 0.521 MeV
    # (0.511 keV rest mass + 10 keV kinetic energy).

    Global ECUT                   = 0.521
    # Global ECUT                     = 10        # Global electron transport cutoff
